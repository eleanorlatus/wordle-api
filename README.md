# Wordle API

A simple API that returns 5 letter words to be used in different word games. I mainly built this to use with my React wordle project but it could be used in different scenarios. 

The API is hosted here: https://wordle-api.cyclic.app

## Getting started

To access the 5 letter words: https://wordle-api.cyclic.app/words

To run the application on your local machine, you can simply install the node modules using:

```bash
npm install
```

## Optimisations

For optimisations, I would add more words to the list and reorganise/tidy up the file structure.
